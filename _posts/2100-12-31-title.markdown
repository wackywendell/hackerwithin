Hi Ana. This is a template for meeting posts. 
In the above yaml markup, you'll see layout. Leave that as "post" unless you 
create a new layout format. The title should be the title of your meeting. 
Comments can be enabled or disabled (disqus) with true or false. Tag it whatever 
you like. The tags attribute can be a space-separated list of words.


# This is a markdown heading

You might put a summary of the meeting here. Whatever. 

## This is a markdown subheading

For more about markdown :

-    Look on the internet, e.g. [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
-    you'll see that there are a lot of tutorials.
-    Mostly, you'll just need to know about the headings and how to make 
     lists and hyperlinks.
